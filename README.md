**Project Overview**
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of bus route data using a multi-step process that includes:

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.

**Database Management:** Storing and managing data in an SQL database.

**Data Visualization:** Creating interactive dashboards in Streamlit for insights and decision-making.

**Features:**
Scrape bus route details including route names, links, bus names, types, departure times, durations, arrival times, ratings, prices, and seat availability.
Store and manage the scraped data in an SQL database.
Create SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.
Visualize data with interactive dashboards in Streamlit.
Analyze key metrics such as total routes, average ratings, and seat availability.

**Technologies Used:**
**Python:** For web scraping and data preprocessing.

**Selenium:** For automating web scraping tasks.

**MySQL:** As the database for storing and managing data.

**Streamlit**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

**Data Preprocessing:**
The preprocessing scripts are written in Python and are responsible for cleaning and transforming the raw data.

**Key tasks include:**

Handling missing values
Normalizing and standardizing data
Encoding categorical variables
Database Management
Data is stored in an SQL database, enabling efficient querying and management.

**Key tables include:**

BusRoutes: Contains bus route details with names and links.
BusDetails: Contains detailed information about each bus including name, type, departure time, duration, arrival time, rating, price, and seat availability.
